Uber Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing ride data for Uber using SQL to extract actionable insights. The goal is to simulate real-world data analysis scenarios typically faced by data analysts in the transportation industry. Inspired by the **OLA Data Analyst Project**, the dataset includes booking details, customer and driver behavior, ride metrics, and financial data.

Key Objectives

* Perform SQL-based analysis on ride-booking data.
* Derive meaningful insights on ride success, cancellations, customer behavior, and ratings.
* Build queries for real-world business metrics like revenue, ride distance, and rating analysis.

Dataset Description

The data was structured and simulated to include 1,00,000 records across the following attributes:

* Booking ID, Status, Date, Time
* Customer ID, Vehicle Type
* Pickup & Drop Locations
* VTAT (Vehicle Time to Arrive), CTAT (Customer Time to Arrive)
* Cancellation Details (Customer/Driver)
* Incomplete Rides & Reasons
* Payment Method, Booking Value
* Ride Distance, Driver & Customer Ratings

SQL Analysis Performed

1. Retrieve all successful bookings
2. Average ride distance by vehicle type
3. Total cancelled rides by customers
4. Top 5 customers with the most bookings
5. Rides cancelled by drivers due to personal & car issues
6. Max and min driver ratings for Prime Sedan
7. Rides paid using UPI
8. Average customer rating per vehicle type
9. Total booking value of successful rides
10. List of incomplete rides with reasons


Insights Gained

* Identified most-used vehicle types and high-value customers
* Analyzed ride completion rate and cancellation trends
* Compared customer and driver ratings
* Measured average ride distances and booking values

Tools Used

* **SQL** (MySQL)
* **Data Source:** Simulated data based on real-world ride-sharing patterns
